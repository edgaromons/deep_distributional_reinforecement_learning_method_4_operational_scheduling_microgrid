# deep_distributional_reinforecement_learning_method_4_operational_scheduling_microgrid
In this project, we developed a method based on Deep Distributional Reinforcement Learning for Operational Scheduling Energy Management in a Microgrid and Considering the Uncertainty.

Here, we basically:

•	Utilized Deep Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in Python to develop and implement intelligent operational scheduling and energy management strategies for microgrids.

•	Developed high-resolution dispatch operation models in Python, incorporating uncertainty modeling to account for variations in VRES and electricity load demand.

•	Applied model-free, data-driven RL techniques in Python for real-time control and optimization of microgrid energy systems.
